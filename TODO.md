# To-Do List

## To Do
- [ ] Add status field that shows message log

- [ ] Introduce DPI auto-scaling to accommodate all screen resolutions

- [ ] Add general options for data processing
  - [ ] Baseline correction of LED emission spectrum (move to general)
  - [ ] Smoothing of LED emission spectrum

## In Progress :)
- [ ] Error handling
  - [ ] Upon save results: ask if users wants to overwrite existing filename
- [ ] Improve tabs functionality
  - [x] Enable closing of tabs
  - [ ] Automatically show newly generated tab

## Completed ✓
- [x] Simplify installation instructions
- [x] Add button to clear loaded data
- Error handling
   - [x] Fix crash upon pressing cancel button in Save Results file window
- [x] Load UI files as .py files generated by pyuic (instead of .ui files) => program can be called from anywhere
- [x] Add configuration file to set defaults (e.g., for Log format)
- [x] Create CITATION.cff
- [x] Release version 1.0.0
- [x] Take into account delays around acquisition of spectra; use actual irradiation times (shift timestamps) for ODE
- [x] Introduce alternative Concentrations method for solving the ODEs: involves initial retrieval of concentrations from absorption spectra by fitting of epsilons spectra
