Licensing Terms for autoQY

Overview

autoQY is distributed under an open-source license for academic and non-commercial use. 
To sustain its development, a dual licensing model has been adopted, allowing users to choose between a free open-source license or a commercial license for proprietary use. Revenue from commercial licenses directly supports the ongoing development of autoQY.

autoQY is offered under two distinct licensing options:

1. **Open Source License**: GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)
2. **Commercial License**: For proprietary use of autoQY

Please review the sections below to determine which license applies to your use of autoQY.

---

1. Open Source License

autoQY is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3). This license allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute the software, provided that any derivative works are also licensed under the GPLv3. 

For the full terms of the GNU General Public License v3, please visit: <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>.

2. Commercial License

A commercial license allows for proprietary use of autoQY without the obligation to distribute derivative works under the GPLv3. This is ideal for companies or individuals who wish to incorporate autoQY into proprietary software.

If you intend to use autoQY in a proprietary product or service and prefer not to distribute your derivative works under the GPLv3, you must obtain a commercial license.  
To inquire about a commercial license, please contact Stefano Crespi at [stefano.crespi@kemi.uu.se](mailto:stefano.crespi@kemi.uu.se).
